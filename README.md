# Basic Basic Visualizer

## Overview

Basic Basic Visualizer is a pathfinding visualization tool built using Python and Pygame. It allows users to visualize various pathfinding algorithms, such as A*, Dijkstra, Greedy Best-First Search, Depth-First Search (DFS), and Breadth-First Search (BFS). This project provides an interactive interface where users can set start and end points, add barriers, and initiate pathfinding algorithms to see how they work in real time.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Click to set start and end points, and add/remove barriers.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Visualize different pathfinding algorithms:
  - A* Search
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Greedy Best-First Search
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch the algorithm find the path in real-time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use with mouse and keyboard controls.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/basic-basic-visualizer.git
   cd basic-basic-visualizer
   
2. Install the required packages:
    pip install pygame

3. Run the application:
    python main.py

## Usage

- Left Click: Set start point, end point, or add a barrier.
- Right Click: Remove a barrier or reset the start/end points.
- Keyboard Shortcuts:
  - Press A to run A* Search
  - Press D to run Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Press G to run Greedy Best-First Search
  - Press SPACE to run DFS
  - Press B to run BFS
